# AI Council Chamber Integration

Multi-agent deliberation and decision-making using the AI Council Chamber.

## Overview

AI Council Chamber is a multi-agent deliberation engine with 24 specialized councilors (Speaker, Technocrat, Ethicist, Visionary, etc.) that can provide multi-perspective analysis on complex topics.

## Performance Considerations

### Model Load Times
- **jan-v3-4b:** ~2 seconds (cached)
- **gpt-oss-20b:** ~10 seconds (first load), ~3 seconds (cached)
- **qwen3-80b:** ~40 seconds (first load), ~8 seconds (cached)
- **jan-v2-max:** ~38 seconds (first load), ~5 seconds (cached)

### Parallel Processing
- **Economy Mode Enabled:** Multiple councilors respond in parallel
- **Max Concurrent:** 2 requests at a time
- **First Load Penalty:** Initial session will be slow as models load

### Optimization Tips
1. **Warm Up Models:** Run a quick session first to load all models
2. **Use Economy Mode:** Enabled by default for parallel responses
3. **Context Pruning:** Automatically prunes to 8 turns to save tokens
4. **Model Caching:** Subsequent sessions are much faster

## Integration with DuckBot

### For Routine Tasks
Use AI Council Chamber when:
- Making strategic decisions
- Evaluating architecture proposals
- Risk assessment
- Security review
- Multi-perspective analysis

### For Quick Tasks
Use direct sub-agent delegation when:
- Simple code changes
- Status checks
- Single-perspective questions
- Fast response required

### For Complex Problems
Use AI Council Chamber when:
- Multiple perspectives needed
- Adversarial testing required
- Risk assessment critical
- Decision quality important
- Stakeholder buy-in needed

## Troubleshooting

### LM Studio Not Responding
```bash
# Check if LM Studio is running
curl http://100.74.88.40:1234/v1/models

# Check model availability
curl http://100.74.88.40:1234/v1/models | jq '.data[].id'
```

### Port 5173 Already in Use
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -i :5173
kill -9 [PID]

# Or use different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### Models Taking Too Long to Load
- First load is expected to be slow (up to 60 seconds)
- Subsequent loads are much faster (3-8 seconds)
- Run a warm-up session first

### Council Not Responding
1. Check LM Studio endpoint in Settings
2. Verify models are loaded on LM Studio
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try with Economy Mode disabled

- Google Search (for research)
- Git repo access
- Postgres queries
- Docker control
- Custom tools

Configure in: Settings > MCP > Tools

## Best Practices

### When to Use AI Council
✅ Complex decisions requiring multiple perspectives
✅ Strategic planning and risk assessment
✅ Architecture review and design evaluation
✅ Security analysis and vulnerability assessment
✅ Multi-vector research and investigation
✅ Probabilistic forecasting and prediction
✅ Adversarial testing and stress-testing ideas

### When NOT to Use AI Council

❌ Routine monitoring tasks (use main agent)
❌ Time-critical operations (too slow with multiple models)

### Council Selection Tips
- **Strategic Decisions:** Use full council (24 members)
- **Quick Decisions:** Use subset (Speaker + 3-4 key councilors)
- **Technical Decisions:** Use Specialists + Technocrat + Skeptic
- **Policy Decisions:** Use Ethicist + Pragmatist + Diplomat + Visionary
- **Security Decisions:** Use Sentinel + Military Specialist + Skeptic
